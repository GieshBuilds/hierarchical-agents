# hierarchical-agents

**Turn isolated [Hermes](https://github.com/GieshBuilds) agent profiles into a coordinated organization with hierarchy, messaging, delegation, and shared memory.**

> **Requires Hermes.** This project is a coordination layer that runs on top of [Hermes](https://github.com/GieshBuilds) — it does not replace it. You need a working Hermes installation with at least one profile before setting this up.

Hermes gives each agent its own profile — an isolated session with its own identity, tools, and state. But profiles can't talk to each other. This project adds the coordination layer: an org chart, an IPC message bus, delegation chains, scoped memory, and worker lifecycle management. Profiles stop being silos and start working as a team.

Pure Python 3.10+ stdlib. Zero external dependencies in core. All persistence via SQLite.

---

## Quick Start

If you have Hermes installed and want to add the hierarchy layer now:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GieshBuilds/hierarchical-agents.git
cd hierarchical-agents
pip install -e .
python scripts/sync_hermes_profiles.py --show-chart   # import your profiles
python -m core show-org-chart                          # verify the result
```

For the complete setup — environment variables, gateway daemons, systemd services, and tool configuration — see **[docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md)**.

## The Problem

Hermes profiles are powerful in isolation. Each one has its own SOUL.md, session history, skills, model selection, and gateway. But out of the box:

- Profiles **can't message each other**
- There's **no hierarchy** — no way to say "the CTO manages these PMs"
- There's **no task delegation** — no way to assign work from one profile to another and get results back
- There's **no shared memory** — each profile's knowledge is locked in its own silo
- There's **no worker tracking** — when a PM spawns a subagent, nothing tracks its lifecycle

This project solves all of that.

## What It Adds

| Capability | What Hermes Has | What This Adds |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| **Identity** | Profile directories with SOUL.md, skills, state | Org chart registry with roles (CEO, Dept Head, PM, Specialist) and flexible hierarchy |
| **Communication** | None between profiles | IPC message bus with priority, TTL, correlation, broadcast, escalation |
| **Delegation** | None | Delegation chains that track tasks through the hierarchy and propagate results back up |
| **Memory** | Per-profile markdown files (MEMORY.md) | Tiered memory (hot/warm/cool/cold) with scoping, GC, shared knowledge base, ancestor read access, and **bidirectional sync** with native Hermes memory |
| **Workers** | Can spawn subagents | Per-PM worker registry with lifecycle tracking (running/sleeping/completed/archived) and completion callbacks |
| **Coordination** | None | ChainOrchestrator for end-to-end task flow with event-driven result propagation |

## How It Works

### The Org Chart (example)

Existing Hermes profiles are synced into a hierarchy via `ProfileBridge`. Each profile gets a role and a parent. The hierarchy is flexible — you structure it however makes sense for your org:

**Flat (PMs report directly to CEO):**
```
         +---------+
         | hermes  |  CEO
         +----+----+
              |
    +---------+---------+
    |         |         |
 +--+--+  +--+--+  +---+---+
 | pm-a |  | pm-b |  | pm-c |  PMs — report directly to CEO
 +--+---+  +------+  +------+
    |
 +--+--+
 |dev-a|  Specialists
 +-----+
```

**Layered (with department heads):**
```
         +---------+
         | hermes  |  CEO
         +----+----+
              |
       +------+------+
       |             |
  +----+----+   +----+----+
  |   CTO   |   |   CMO   |  Dept Heads
  +----+----+   +----+----+
       |             |
  +----+----+   +----+----+
  |backend-pm|  | mktg-pm |  PMs
  +----+-----+  +---------+
       |
  +----+----+
  |  dev-*  |  Specialists
  +----+----+
       |
   +---+---+
   | sa-*  |  Workers (disposable)
   +-------+
```

Any non-CEO role can report to any other profile. The only hard rules: one CEO (auto-created as `hermes`), every other profile must have a parent, and no circular references.

Each of these is a real Hermes profile with its own `~/.hermes/profiles/<name>/` directory. The hierarchy layer organizes them, gives them tools to communicate, and tracks work flowing between them.

### Task Flow

1. **Task arrives** at a profile's inbox as a `TASK_REQUEST` message
2. **Profile delegates** down to a report or spawns a worker
3. **Worker executes** the task and completes with a result
4. **Result propagates up** through each hop in the delegation chain via `TASK_RESPONSE` messages
5. **Originator receives** the final result

Each step is tracked, persisted, and auditable. Messages have priority levels (urgent/normal/low), TTL expiry, and correlation IDs for threading conversations.

### Memory Model

Each profile gets scoped memory on top of Hermes' native session state:

- **Personal memory** — decisions, learnings, context scoped to their role. Entries age through tiers (hot -> warm -> cool -> cold) with automatic garbage collection.
- **Shared knowledge base** — organizational knowledge any agent can publish to or search. Standards, decisions, patterns that the whole org needs.
- **Ancestor access** — agents can read memory from profiles above them in the chain of command (read-up only, never sideways).
- **Bidirectional sync** — a memory bridge syncs between Hermes' native `MEMORY.md` files and the hierarchy's structured SQLite memory. Native memories are imported into the hierarchy store; hierarchy context is exported to `HIERARCHY_CONTEXT.md` so Hermes reads it at session startup. Sync runs on profile activation.

### What Gets Installed

When you set up the hierarchy, it adds to your existing Hermes installation:

```
~/.hermes/hierarchy/              # New — all coordination state
  ├── registry.db                 # Org chart (profiles, roles, parents)
  ├── ipc.db                      # Message bus
  ├── chains.db                   # Delegation chain tracking
  ├── memory/<profile>.db         # Per-profile scoped memory
  ├── memory/knowledge.db         # Shared knowledge base
  └── workers/<pm>/subagents.db   # Per-PM worker registry

~/.hermes/profiles/<name>/        # Existing Hermes profiles — updated with:
  ├── SOUL.md                     # Updated with hierarchy role + tools
  ├── HANDOFF.md                  # How to receive/return work via IPC
  ├── WORKFLOWS.md                # Standard operating procedures
  └── TOOLS.md                    # Lists 12 new hierarchy tools
```

### Tools Given to Agents

Every profile in the hierarchy gets these tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `send_to_profile` | Send a task or message to any profile in the org chart |
| `check_inbox` | Read pending messages and task results |
| `org_chart` | View the full organizational hierarchy |
| `profile_status` | Check if a profile is active, see their workload |
| `spawn_tracked_worker` | Spawn a worker subagent with lifecycle tracking |
| `get_project_status` | Check status of delegated work and workers |
| `save_memory` | Persist decisions and context to personal memory |
| `search_knowledge` | Search the shared knowledge base |
| `share_knowledge` | Publish knowledge for other profiles to find |
| `read_ancestor_memory` | Read memory from profiles above you in the chain |
| `get_chain_context` | Pull context from your full chain of command |
| `create_profile` | Register a new profile in the hierarchy |

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **[Hermes](https://github.com/GieshBuilds)** installed with at least one profile in `~/.hermes/profiles/`
- Python 3.10+

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GieshBuilds/hierarchical-agents.git
cd hierarchical-agents
pip install -e .
```

### Sync Your Hermes Profiles

```bash
python scripts/sync_hermes_profiles.py --show-chart
```

This scans `~/.hermes/profiles/`, registers your profiles in the hierarchy, and prints the org chart. Re-running is safe — existing profiles are skipped.

### Build a Hierarchy

```python
from core.registry import ProfileRegistry
from core.ipc import MessageBus
from core.workers import SubagentRegistry
from core.integration import ChainOrchestrator

# Initialize — CEO 'hermes' is created automatically
registry = ProfileRegistry(":memory:")

# Add agents to the org chart
registry.create_profile(name="cto", role="department_head", parent="hermes")
registry.create_profile(name="backend-pm", role="project_manager", parent="cto")

# Set up messaging and orchestration
bus = MessageBus(":memory:")
orchestrator = ChainOrchestrator(
    registry=registry,
    bus=bus,
    worker_registry_factory=lambda pm: SubagentRegistry(":memory:"),
)
```

### Delegate a Task

```python
# Create a delegation chain
chain = orchestrator.create_chain("Build the API", originator="hermes")

# Route it down: CEO -> CTO -> PM
orchestrator.delegate(chain, "hermes", "cto")
orchestrator.delegate(chain, "cto", "backend-pm")

# PM spawns a worker to do the actual work
worker_id = orchestrator.spawn_worker(chain, "backend-pm", "Implement /users endpoint")

# Worker completes — result auto-propagates back up to hermes
orchestrator.complete_worker(chain, "backend-pm", worker_id, "Endpoint implemented")
```

### Send Messages Directly

```python
from core.ipc import MessageProtocol, MessagePriority

protocol = MessageProtocol(bus)

# Request/response pattern
msg_id, corr_id = protocol.send_request(
    from_profile="hermes",
    to_profile="cto",
    payload={"task": "Review backend architecture"},
    priority=MessagePriority.URGENT,
)

# Recipient polls their inbox
messages = bus.poll("cto")

# Respond
protocol.send_response(
    correlation_id=corr_id,
    from_profile="cto",
    to_profile="hermes",
    payload={"result": "Architecture approved"},
)
```

### CLI

```bash
# Profile management
python -m core create-profile --name cto --display-name CTO \
    --role department_head --parent hermes
python -m core list-profiles --json
python -m core show-org-chart

# Messaging
python -m core send-message --from hermes --to cto --type task_request \
    --payload '{"task": "review architecture"}' --priority urgent
python -m core poll-messages --profile cto

# Memory
python -m core inspect-memory hermes --memory-db ./memory.db --scope strategic
python -m core search-knowledge hermes "database standards"

# Stats
python -m core ipc-stats
```

## Design Philosophy

**Extend, don't replace.** Hermes profiles are the foundation. This project adds coordination on top — it doesn't replace Hermes' session management, skill system, or gateway infrastructure.

**Stdlib only.** Zero external dependencies in core. `sqlite3` for persistence, `typing.Protocol` for interfaces, `dataclasses` for models.

**SQLite everywhere.** Every stateful component persists to SQLite. Thread-safe, zero-config, single-file databases. Pass `":memory:"` for testing or a file path for production.

**Hierarchy is enforced, not suggested.** The registry validates every profile creation and delegation against hierarchy rules. Circular references are prevented. Role constraints are checked.

**Tasks are tracked end-to-end.** Delegation chains record every hop from originator to worker. Results propagate back up the same path. Nothing gets lost in the middle.

**Memory has a lifecycle.** Entries start hot and age through warm, cool, and cold tiers based on access patterns. Garbage collection enforces budgets. Agents don't accumulate unbounded context.

## Web Dashboard

A browser UI for monitoring and managing the hierarchy.

### Install Dependencies

The dashboard requires Flask and websockets (not needed for core functionality):

```bash
pip install -e ".[ui]"
```

### Launch

```bash
python -m ui
# Starts at http://localhost:5000
# WebSocket for real-time updates on ws://localhost:5001/ws
```

### Options

```bash
python -m ui --port 8080           # Custom HTTP port
python -m ui --ws-port 8081        # Custom WebSocket port
python -m ui --no-realtime         # Disable real-time updates (no WebSocket)
```

### What You Get

| Page | What It Shows |
|------|-------------|
| **Org Chart** | Interactive hierarchy tree with roles and status |
| **Messages** | IPC message bus — pending, delivered, read, expired |
| **Workers** | Subagent status per PM — running, sleeping, completed |
| **Chains** | Delegation chain tracking with hop-by-hop status |
| **Memory** | Per-profile memory browser with tier filtering |
| **Dashboard** | Aggregate metrics and system health |

Real-time mode polls the SQLite databases for changes and pushes updates to connected browsers via WebSocket.
